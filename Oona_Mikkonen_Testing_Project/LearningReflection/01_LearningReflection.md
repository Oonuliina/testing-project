> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- It was quite good, the website was a bit laggy when I was testing, so it was a little bit annoying.  
     
## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?

- I watched the teatchers video and do the assignment based on that. 

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
 
 - Not really any that I know     

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

- Visual Studio Code 
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- I had a bit hard time understanding the assignment at first, but I think I got a hang of it after all. 
I think it was a little bit hard to know what info is relevant or how specific it should be when writing the test cases. I think it is just a thing what you learn when you practise more.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

- I had no problems using Github. I have used Github many times before with other courses.
 
## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

- I think I would use the Robot Framework, just because it seems to be quite clear and easy. 

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing-

- Knowledge of test automation frameworks, teamwork skills, knowledge of cloud services and knowledge of agile development methods.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

-  Mostly more knowledge and technical skills about software testing as this course was my first touch to the software testing world.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

- I think the course was good for begginners and this final task taught me the most, even though it was good to go trough the theory part first. I think it would be nice if there was more of this kind of "hands on" tasks.
Atleast for me it is the best way to learn and actually understand the theory behind it.
